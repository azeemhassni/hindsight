# Changelog

## M0 — Foundations

- Swift 6 package with `HindsightCore` and `HindsightProcess`, macOS 14 minimum.
- Domain model: validated identifiers, servers, schedules, retention policies,
  backup profiles, snapshots and their tag convention, job kinds, secrets.
- Subprocess layer: line-oriented streaming, cancellation that kills the child,
  an environment allowlist instead of inheritance, and secret redaction across
  output and errors.

## M1 — Pinned binary provisioning

- `scripts/vendor.sh` downloads, verifies, and extracts restic 0.19.1 (linux
  amd64/arm64, darwin amd64/arm64) and rest-server 0.14.0 (darwin amd64/arm64),
  checking each artifact twice: the archive against the upstream `SHA256SUMS`,
  and the extracted executable against a digest pinned in git.
- `BinaryStore` verifies a binary before it is used, locally or remotely, and
  fails closed on a mismatch.
- The pinned table is generated from `vendor/checksums.txt` so the digests the
  app enforces cannot drift from the ones the vendoring script enforces.
